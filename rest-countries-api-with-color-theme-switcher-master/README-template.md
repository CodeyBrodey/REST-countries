## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Lots of learning with this one! I have to admit this project took me longer than what I was expecting.
First thing I got to practice a lot with was React as it was my second time using it. Got comfortable using useState and useEffect.
Second is fetching data to manipulate and show it. 
And the last main thing I learned was making a search-bar and getting it to work with the filter.
Had fun with this and learned a lot!

### Continued development

I would still like to get used to fetching data and hoping to get more comfortable with React.
